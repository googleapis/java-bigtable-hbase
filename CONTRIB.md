4. We are following HBase code formatting conventions.  If you use Eclipse or IntelliJ 13+ you can import `hbase_eclipse_formatter.xml` into your IDE.  If you aren't using an IDE, eyeball it try to follow existing conventions in the code.  We'll clean it up before we cut each release.
5. Avoid approving your own PR's except when you are doing documentation changes or truly trivial quick-fixes.

Thanks!
