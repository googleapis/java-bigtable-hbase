# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Developing and testing

1. Run `mvn clean install` to build and install Cloud Bigtable client artifacts to your local repository, and then run the unit tests.
2. There is also a suite of integration tests that connect to a cluster you have access to, via the authentication credentials that were loaded during the Google Cloud SDK configuration step (see above).

   Use the following command to run the Cloud Bigtable integration tests for HBase 1:

   ```sh
   mvn clean verify \
       -PbigtableIntegrationTest \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.project.id=[your cloud project id] \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.instance.id=[your cloud bigtable instance id]
   ```

   Use the following command to run the Cloud Bigtable integration tests for HBase 2:

   ```sh
   mvn clean verify \
       -PbigtableIntegrationTestH2 \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.project.id=[your cloud project id] \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.instance.id=[your cloud bigtable instance id]
   ```
   
   There are also tests that perform compatibility tests against an HBase Minicluster, which can be invoked with the following commands for HBase 1 and HBase 2 respectively: 
   ```sh
   mvn clean verify -Penable-integration-tests -PhbaseLocalMiniClusterTest
   ```
   ```sh
   mvn clean verify -Penable-integration-tests -PhbaseLocalMiniClusterTestH2
   ```

   You can run those commands at the top of the project, or you can run them at the appropriate integration-tests project.  
   
   Developer's NOTE: You can build the project faster by running the following command, and then run the integration test command from the appropriate integration test directory:
   
   ```sh
   mvn -pl bigtable-hbase-1.x-parent/bigtable-hbase-1.x-integration-tests \
   -pl bigtable-hbase-2.x-parent/bigtable-hbase-2.x-integration-tests \
   -am clean install
   ```
3. Run `mvn -X com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:format` to check and enforce consistent java formatting to all of your code changes.

4. You can use [google-cloud-bigtable-emulator][google-cloud-bigtable-emulator] for local testing. The minimum configuration requires to connect the emulator with `bigtable-core-client` OR `hbase-client`:
    ```java
    @Rule
    public final BigtableEmulatorRule bigtableEmulator = BigtableEmulatorRule.create();
    private BigtableSession session;
    private Connection connection;
    
    @Setup
    public void setup() {
      // for bigtable-core
      BigtableOptions opts = BigtableOptions.builder()
            .enableEmulator("localhost:" + bigtableEmulator.getPort())
            .setUserAgent("fake")
            .setProjectId("fakeproject")
            .setInstanceId("fakeinstance")
            .build();
      this.session = new BigtableSession(opts);
    
      // for hbase
      Configuration config = BigtableConfiguration.configure("fakeproject", "fakeinstance");
      config.set("google.bigtable.emulator.endpoint.host", "localhost:" + bigtableEmulator.getPort());
      this.connection = BigtableConfiguration.connect(config);
    }
    ```

NOTE: This project uses extensive shading which IDEs have trouble with. To overcome these issues,
disable the `with-shaded` profile in your IDE to force it to resolve the dependencies from your local
maven repository. When you disable that profile, attach workspace sources to the local maven repository jars.
