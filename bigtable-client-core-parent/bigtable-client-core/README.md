bigtable-client-core is in the process of being replaced with a direct dependency on [java-bigtable](https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigtable) in 2.x.x releases of [java-bigtable-hbase](https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigtable-hbase). If
you are using bigtable-client-core directly, you can find its source in the bigtable-1.x
branch: https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigtable-hbase/tree/bigtable-1.x/bigtable-client-core-parent/bigtable-client-core/

However, customers are encouraged to migrate to [java-bigtable](https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigtable).
