                                KEEP shadedArtifactAttached=false.  DO NOTE CHANGE shadedArtifactAttached to true!

                                Dependencies get messed up if shadedArtifactAttached=true.  The relocations
                                are vital to get around dependency mismatches between hbase and cloud bigtable.
                                Specifically, CBT and hbase use different versions of guava and netty.  Relocations
                                are a way to get around those types of incompatibilities.

                                Using shadedArtifactAttached=true causes some tricky issues.  If =true is on,
                                then the main artifact isn't usable, because of the incompatibility issues in the artifacts found
                                in the relocations section.  If HBase updates its dependencies to compatible versions, then
                                this project will not need to relocate and include those dependencies in a shaded jar.

                                As an example, the start up of hbase requires guava, and using a newer version of guava causes
                                startup issues.  If an older version of guava is in the classpath, then HBase classes will load
                                fine, but CBT will have runtime issues.

                                Additionally, if shadedArtifactAttached=true there are even ssues using the shaded classifier.
                                Using the shaded classifier will pull in the right bigtable-hbase-1.2-shaded-${project.version}.jar,
                                but it will also pull in bigtable-hbase and bigtable-protos as dependencies, which might
                                cause classloading issues in some cases like web apps.
