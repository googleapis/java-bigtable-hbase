/**
 * MirroringClient uses asynchronous tasks to perform operations on the secondary database.
 * Operations on the secondary database can take longer than operation on primary and thus we might
 * have a long tail of scheduled or in-flight operations (the length of the tail is limited by the
 * {@link com.google.cloud.bigtable.mirroring.core.utils.flowcontrol.FlowController}). For this
 * reason we have to count scheduled requests and prevent closing resources they use (Tables,
 * ResultScanners, Connections, etc.) before all requests using that resource are completed. To
 * achieve this we are using manual reference counting - each scheduled asynchronous operation
 * increments reference counter of all resources it is using (e.g. scheduled {@link Table#get(Get)}
 * increments reference counter of the Table and Connection, {@link ResultScanner#next()} increments
 * ResultScanner's, Table's and Connection's reference counters).
 *
 * <p>There are other, less complicated approaches possible (for example we could have only a single
 * reference counter for Connection object, or a bit simpler hierarchical approach in which every
 * level of the hierarchy (Connection, Table, ResultScanner) counts its requests and only increments
 * (decrements) reference counter of their parent level when it is created (closed)) but they
 * wouldn't allow us to achieve two goals of our design:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If the user calls close() on a Mirroring* object, we should also call close() on underlying
 *       secondary object, but only after all requests using that object have finished.
 *   <li>If the user doesn't call close() on a Mirroring* object (because some users might not close
 *       their Tables) we shouldn't close underlying secondary as well, but this shouldn't prevent
 *       closing its parent Connection object if the user closes it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The second point is critical for us because {@link MirroringConnection#close()} call blocks until
 * all requests using that Connection are finished. Counting created Tables (which would happen in
 * the second example of simpler reference counting scheme described above) would cause deadlocks.
